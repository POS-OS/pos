# The Fedora compiler searches /usr. Put /pos ahead of it, as the POS
# compiler searches /pos. -isystem, not -I: glibc headers must stay system
# headers so packages that build with -Werror do not fail on warnings
# inside them. C_INCLUDE_PATH is treated like -isystem; CPATH would act
# like -I. /usr stays in the search after /pos, so a library missing from
# /pos is still found in the tools image (BUILD.md "Core libs stage").
