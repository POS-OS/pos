# must not be named again: that moves it in front of the libstdc++
# directories, gcc drops the later duplicate, and libstdc++'s
# #include_next <stdlib.h> then finds nothing after itself.
#
# No -rpath: the POS loader finds /pos/lib by itself. Its cache is
# /etc/pos/ld.so.cache, not the build container's /etc/ld.so.cache (BUILD.md
# "Core libs stage").
