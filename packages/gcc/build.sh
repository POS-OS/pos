  # gcc's top-level configure derives CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET from CFLAGS, so the
  # flags of _pkg_flags would reach libgcc, libstdc++ and the other target
  # libraries, which choose their own (libgcc is built without the stack
  # protector). The compiler is built with the optimization and debug info
  # only, as upstream's default -g -O2; the link flags stay.

  # The compiler's own programs (cc1, cc1plus, lto1, collect2) run under the
  # POS loader like everything else in /pos, so the ambient /pos link flags
  # from _pkg_setup stay on. The target libraries are built by the new xgcc
  # with the patched defaults.
  #
  # What the compiler runs on is glibc only: gmp, mpfr and mpc from the tree,
  # gcc's bundled zlib, no zstd (LTO streams are zlib-compressed), and
  # libstdc++ and libgcc linked statically.
  # --with-as/--with-ld bake the POS binutils paths into the driver.
  # --without-isl pins the Graphite check so a change to the tools image
  # cannot change the result. libcc1 installs into the building compiler's
  # multilib directory (libcc1/configure.ac: $CXX -print-multi-os-directory),
  # which Fedora's g++ answers with ../lib64; it is gdb's compile plugin.
