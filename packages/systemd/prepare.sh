# systemd's libseccomp version check (>= 2.4.0) is removed: both are built
# from this repository, and libseccomp's version is set by its prepare
# recipe, not by upstream's release process.
#
# systemd reads its drop-in directories (tmpfiles.d, sysusers.d, sysctl.d,
# modules-load.d, binfmt.d, udev/rules.d, ...) and kernel-install its
# plugins from /etc, /run, /usr/local/lib and /usr/lib only; the prefix is
# not among them, as it is for units. LIBDIR (<prefix>/lib) is added before
# /usr/lib, as units have the prefix before /usr/lib: POS's own files come
# from /pos/lib, and other packages' (Fedora's through pos-fedora, a hosted
# kernel's) are still read from /usr/lib.
