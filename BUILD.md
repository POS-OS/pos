# Building
`./build` (`buildsys/build.sh`) builds the release: every stage (see
"Trees"), each assembled into one archive, and the outputs in `outputs/`
(images, disks, RPM packages; see "Build outputs"). It
runs on the host or in any toolbox and needs the host's podman, which it
reaches through `flatpak-spawn --host` from inside a toolbox, as the
`toolbox` CLI does. Every step of a build runs in a container of its own
(see "Build containers").

    $ ./build plan                 # what run would build, in order
    $ ./build run --new --toolchain  # build the toolchain (see "Toolchain")
    $ ./build reference            # store it as the toolchain reference of later builds
    $ ./build run                  # build and assemble every stage
    $ ./build run core-libs        # one stage
    $ ./build run zlib             # one package (and what it needs)
    $ ./build prepare              # prepare sources ahead of a run
    $ ./build status
    $ ./build output               # make the outputs of the current build again
    $ ./build output rpm-pos       # one output: the pos RPM package
    $ devtools/install.sh          # install the archives as /pos
    $ devtools/try-rpm.sh          # try out the RPM packages
    $ ./build output fedora-toolbox  # POS as a toolbox image
    $ devtools/vm.sh               # boot the vm-disk-dnf disk in a VM
    $ devtools/vm.sh -c devtools/smoke.sh  # check it: boot, run the checks, power off
    $ devtools/compare-builds.sh <id> <id>  # what differs between two builds

## Builds
A build has an ID (a timestamp) and keeps everything under
`work/builds/<id>`: `dest/<package>` staging trees, `debug/<package>` debug
info (see "Debug info"), `logs/<package>.log`, the stage archives
`pos-<stage>-<stem>.tar.zst` with their `pos-debug-<stage>-<stem>.tar.zst`,
and what the outputs make: the RPM packages in `rpm/`, image archives
`pos-<output>-<stem>.tar.zst` and disks `pos-<output>-<stem>.qcow2`, with
their logs `logs/output-<output>.log`, where `<stem>` is
`<major>.<minor>-<build>.<release>` (see "Build numbers"). `work/builds/current`
points at the build that `run` continues. `run --new` starts another, a
pos build, or a toolchain build with `--toolchain` (`info`: `pipeline`;
see "Toolchain"). A
package is built once per build; `./build rebuild <package>` drops it
from the current build so the next `run` builds it again. Packages that were
built against it are not rebuilt. A package that a bootstrap package
stands in for is rebuilt with what replaced the bootstrap package:
`rebuild systemd util-linux`, since util-linux, built against systemd,
otherwise takes util-linux-bootstrap's place in systemd's environment
("systemd: needs systemd"). Builds from before build containers
(their `info` has no `tools-image`) cannot be continued; `status` and
`reference` still work on them.

## Build numbers
A build is identified by its ID, the timestamp it was created with. An OS
build, one that ships, also gets a BUILD number: `VERSION` holds the
number main's next numbered build gets. The project owners number a build
with `./build tag`, or `./build publish`, which also publishes it (see
"Releases"):

1. `./build validate` checks the current build from what its producers
   recorded. Every producer records what it made in `made/<name>`
   (`package-<package>`, `stage-<stage>`, `output-<output>`): the
   commit it was made from and whether the tree had uncommitted changes.
   It drops its record and `complete` before it starts, so a failed one
   leaves neither. A default `run` that finishes records `complete`;
   `rebuild` drops the records of the dropped packages and of everything
   made from packages.
   The build is an OS build when it is a pos build with `complete`, every
   record names its commit with a clean tree, and its BUILD (`VERSION` at
   its commit) is above every `main-*` tag.
2. The build's commit is tagged `main-<BUILD>`, an annotated tag with the
   build ID, its identifier, the references and whether checks were
   skipped.
3. `./build bump` commits `VERSION` with the next BUILD, as pos-bot. Run
   it alone when `tag` or `publish` failed after tagging.

Checks belong to their producer. An output with a disk checks it with
`disk_check`, a script that `devtools/vm.sh` runs in the booted disk
(vm-disk and vm-disk-dnf: `devtools/smoke.sh`); the output is recorded
only when it passes. `run --no-checks` and `output --no-checks` skip
checks and record the output `unchecked`, which `validate --unchecked`,
`tag --unchecked` and `publish --unchecked` accept.

Every build carries the version of `VERSION` at the commit it was created
at, tagged or not: a tag changes no artifact. `VERSION` holds the
product version (`PRODUCT_VERSION=1.0`, `<major>.<minor>`), the product
release (`PRODUCT_RELEASE`: a static string, or empty for
`<branch>.<timestamp>`), the service release revision (`REVISION`, 0
for now), the RPM release number (`RPM_RELEASE`) and `BUILD`. A new build
records them in its `info` (`product-version`, `product-release`,
`release-type`, `revision`, `rpm-release`, `build-number`), with the
default product release made of the branch (what rpm does not allow in a
release becomes `_`) and the build ID as `20261017-1524`. `run --new`
refuses a commit whose `VERSION` lacks a field or has a malformed one.
Builds made before `VERSION` had a product version have no names for
their artifacts: `run` does not continue them and `output` does not make
their outputs; `status`, `validate` and `reference` still work on them.

The version names the build (`buildsys/buildinfo.sh`), for product
version 1.0, BUILD 3, revision 0 and release `main.20261017-1524`:

* the identifier: `1.0.3.0.main.20261017-1524`
  (`<product version>.<build>.<revision>.<release>`), in the tag and
  os-release;
* artifacts: `<artifact>-<major>.<minor>-<build>.<release>`, in the build
  directory and the release library alike:
  `pos-system-1.0-3.main.20261017-1524.tar.zst`;
* RPM packages: version `<major>.<minor>.0`, release
  `<rpm release>.<release>` without the timestamp's `-`, which rpm does not
  allow: `pos-1.0.0-1.main.202610171524.x86_64.rpm`. Updates of a product
  version sort by the RPM release number first, then the release: raise
  `RPM_RELEASE` for a branch from main on the same product version, and
  for each new static product release. A static product release has only
  what rpm allows (letters, digits and `. _ + ~ ^`);
* os-release (assembled into the stage that has it; os-release(5)):
  `PRETTY_NAME="POS 1.0"`, `VERSION="main.20261017-1524"`,
  `VERSION_ID=1.0`, `BUILD_ID=1.0.3.0.main.20261017-1524`,
  `POS_BUILD=3.0` (the OS build, `<build>.<revision>`, which has no
  field of its own) and `RELEASE_TYPE`, `development` for a
  `<branch>.<timestamp>` release and `stable` for a static one. `NAME`
  stays `POS`, without a version;
* podman images: tagged `:<id>` and with the product version (`:1.0`),
  which moves to the build that made the image last, labelled
  `pos.version` with the identifier.

`tag` runs on main, with `VERSION` at HEAD still the build's BUILD. Every
commit between two bumps carries the same BUILD; only the tagged one is
that build. Neither command pushes.

## Releases
`./build publish [--unchecked]` numbers the current build as `tag` does
and copies its artifacts into the release library, the `release-dir`
setting (a local directory for now), as `<release-dir>/<release>`, the
release named as the artifacts are (`1.0-3.main.20261017-1524`): the
build's `info`, everything named after it (stage and debug archives,
image archives with their package lists, disks, the recipes archive), its
source archives, its RPM packages in `rpm/`, and `SHA256SUMS`. It refuses
a release that is there already, and one whose RPM packages would not
update those of a release of the same product version there (the same
version-release, or a lower RPM release number). The release is filled
under a temporary name and appears once the tag is made; then `VERSION`
is bumped.

The toolbox image is not published: `devtools/release-toolbox.sh
<release>` makes it in podman from the release's container-fs-dnf, with
this checkout's `outputs/fedora-toolbox`, tagged with the release and the
product version:

    $ devtools/release-toolbox.sh 1.0-3.main.20261017-1524
    $ toolbox create -i localhost/pos-fedora-toolbox:1.0 <name>

## Settings
Settings of `./build` are lines of `<key> <value>` in
`~/.config/pos/build.conf`, or in the file `POS_BUILD_CONFIG` names.
`build.conf.dist` lists them; copy it there and edit. Each setting's
environment variable overrides the file, for a single run. Only a new
build reads them: what it uses is recorded in its `info`, so a build
keeps its settings when the file changes. The file is read as data, and
an unknown key is an error.

| key | variable | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fedora-release` | `POS_FEDORA_RELEASE` | 44 |
| `tools-image` | `POS_TOOLS_IMAGE` | `registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:<release>` |
| `reference-dir` | `POS_REFERENCE_DIR` | none: no reference store |
| `toolchain-reference` | `POS_TOOLCHAIN_REFERENCE` | the store's default (see "Reference builds"); `none`: a build with Fedora's compiler |
| `pos-reference` | `POS_POS_REFERENCE` | a pos build: its toolchain reference's; a toolchain build: the store's default |
| `release-dir` | `POS_RELEASE_DIR` | none: `publish` needs it; read by `publish`, not recorded by builds |

## Trees
What POS builds is in `pos/`, divided into trees: `pos/<tree>/` has any
of `packages/<name>/` (recipes, see "Packages"), `src/<source>` with
`src/<source>.upstream` (sources, see "Sources") and `stage`, the member
list of the stage named after the tree.

| Tree | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `core-libs`, `system`, `sdk` | the stages: their member lists, and the packages and sources of their members |
| `network`, `container` | the optional stages (see "Network stage", "Container stage"), as the stages above |
| `toolchain` | the toolchain pipeline (see "Toolchain"): linux-headers, binutils, gcc with gcc-runtime, and mpc, which gcc builds in its tree |
| `common` | sources of packages of several trees: gnulib |
| `build-env` | the host and profile packages builds require (host-base, host-toolchain, gcc-host, host-linux-headers, pos-link) |

A package lives in the tree of the stage that ships it, and one no stage
ships by its role. The toolchain is the exception: the sdk stage (and
core-libs, gcc-runtime) lists toolchain packages, which a pos build takes
from its toolchain reference, while their recipes and sources are the `toolchain`
tree, so that tree is exactly what toolchain builds build. A stage's
`stage` file lists packages of any tree.

Package names are unique across trees, and so are source names; meta and
stage files name packages without their tree, so a package moves between
stages without edits elsewhere. A package's sources (`source`,
`with-sources`) are its own tree's or `common`'s. A source of another
tree is named with it, `<tree>/<source>`, which shows what crosses trees:
gcc builds core-libs' gmp and mpfr in its tree (`with-sources
core-libs/gmp core-libs/mpfr mpc`).

## Sources
POS builds from upstream source, not from upstream releases, so it does
the release preparation itself. A source goes through three steps:

1. Sync: `pos/<tree>/src/<source>` holds exactly the files upstream's git
   tracks, and `src/<source>.upstream` next to it records the branch
   (`ref`), `commit`, commit `date` and `url` it came from. Both are
   committed. Upstream's submodules are part of the tree, except those
   that are sources of their own (gnulib, paxutils), which packages take
   from their `src/<name>`.
2. Prepare: what upstream's release process adds to a release tarball.
   `prepare.sh` of the package named after the source works on a copy of
   the committed source, with helpers from `buildsys/prepare.sh`:
   `prep_pull` runs gnulib bootstrap's pull phase or `autopull.sh`
   (translations, submodule hooks), `prep_gen` generates the build system,
   `prep_version` writes `.tarball-version`, `prep_cargo_vendor` vendors
   a Rust source's crates (`cargo vendor`). Files gnulib-tool links to
   gnulib (`pos/common/src/gnulib`) are copied, so the prepared tree stands
   alone. Prepare runs in a build container with network access, which has
   the recipes, the committed source, gnulib and the tree to prepare, into which the package's
   `with-sources` are copied first (tar's and cpio's bootstrap imports
   files from `paxutils`); `prepare-requires` in the meta lists its Fedora
   packages.
3. Build: from the prepared tree when the source has a prepare recipe, from
   the committed source otherwise. A build needs no network.

Everything that changes or generates source files belongs to prepare:
autogen.sh, bootstrap and autoreconf, generators such as less's
`Makefile.aut`, and edits to upstream files (systemd's libseccomp version
check, shadow's `chsh.c`). A build recipe configures, compiles and installs
a tree it does not change. Sources that need none of that (glibc, gcc,
zlib, the meson and cmake packages, and bash, sqlite and sudo, which commit
their `configure`) have no prepare recipe and are built from their
committed source.

Prepared trees are kept in `work/sources/<source>/<key>`. The key is a hash
of the committed source tree, its `.upstream`, the prepare recipe, the
helpers, the `prepare-requires`, the committed gnulib for
packages that use gnulib, and the committed `with-sources`. A tree is prepared once for each key and shared by
every package built from that source (util-linux, util-linux-bootstrap),
every build that copies it into its own tree (gcc builds gmp, mpfr and mpc
in its tree), and later builds. `run` prepares a source when it
first needs it; `./build prepare` does it ahead of time. Builds and
prepare use the committed state of a source, so uncommitted changes under
its `src/<source>` stop them.

The version prepare gives packages that take theirs from gnulib's
git-version-gen (coreutils, findutils, grep, gzip, sed, diffutils, patch)
is a snapshot name, not a release number: `<ref>-<commit date>-<commit>`,
for example `master-20260924-5eff02ecb19b` (`prep_version`). Other packages
keep the version their own source states. util-linux and logrotate carry
older copies of git-version-gen that accept only a version starting with a
digit; util-linux takes its version from `NEWS`. libseccomp's `main`
says `0.0.0` in `configure.ac` until a release sets it; its prepare
recipe sets the newest release in `CHANGELOG`, which is also the library's
soname (`libseccomp.so.2`) and `SCMP_VER_*`.

Each package's metadata records the source it was built from:
`build-source <source> <key>`, the prepared tree's key or the committed
tree's hash.

## Source archives
`./build run --new --source-archives` creates a build that, after
assembling the stages, archives every source its packages were built from,
as recorded in their metadata: `pos-src-<source>-<key>.tar.zst`, the
prepared tree or the committed tree. It also archives the build recipes as
they are at `HEAD` (`buildsys`, the trees' `packages` and `stage`, `outputs`,
the docs) as
`pos-recipes-<stem>.tar.zst`, with a warning if they changed since the build
started. Together they are the source of the build's archives. Whether a
build writes them is chosen when it is created.

## Packages
A tree's `packages/<name>/` holds `build.sh`, the recipe, and `meta`, which declares
what the package needs and what it gives (format in `buildsys/resolve.sh`):

    build-requires gcc pos-link
    requires glibc ncurses readline
    provides util-linux-bootstrap
    obsoletes util-linux-bootstrap
    host-requires meson ninja-build

`requires` are run-time requirements, installed along with the package
wherever it is installed. `build-requires` are needed only to build it.
Every package provides its own name. When two available packages provide
what is required, the one the other obsoletes is not used. `host-requires`
are Fedora packages, in the build's tools image (see "Build containers");
`host-base` (`pos/build-env/packages/host-base`) lists the tools every
build gets.

Go and Rust packages (the container stage's) build with Fedora's
compilers, from the tools image (`host-requires golang`, `rust cargo`):
POS builds neither yet. `pkg_go_env` (`buildsys/pkg.sh`) sets up a Go
build with the source's committed `vendor/` modules, and `pkg_cargo`
builds with cargo from the crates prepare vendored; both offline. Their
programs link with the environment's gcc and LDFLAGS, as C programs do:
against `/pos/lib`, with the POS loader as interpreter, and with a build
ID for the debug info. What cargo builds to run in the build, build
scripts and proc-macros, links with the host's `cc` instead
(`host-requires gcc`): rustc loads proc-macros into itself, on the tools
image's glibc, which may be older than POS's. `pkg_cargo` passes an
explicit `--target` for that, which keeps RUSTFLAGS to the target's crates.

`pipeline toolchain` marks a package of the toolchain (see "Toolchain").
`kind source` is a directory with only a prepare recipe, for a source
other packages copy into their tree (mpc).

`run` picks a package whose requirements are all available (built in this
build, host packages, or from a reference build), builds it, and repeats
until the targets are built. Where several are ready, a package obsoleted
by another ready one waits. A build does not see the whole build history:
its `/pos` holds exactly the package's requirements, plus the run-time
requirements of those.

## Outputs
One build can produce several packages, as an rpm spec has sub-packages.
The main package lists them (`outputs gcc-runtime`); each has its own
package directory, with a `meta` of `kind output` and `output-of`, and no
`build.sh`. After the build, an output is a package like any other: its
own `dest/<name>`, requirements, provides, obsoletes and metadata, and a
stage lists it on its own. Wanting an output builds its main package;
`rebuild` of the main package drops its outputs too.

The recipe installs each output into `$(pkg_output <name>)`. `pkg_finish`
then removes from the main package every file an output holds, so each file
belongs to one package and the recipe can install everything first.
Requirements an output provides are not part of its own build's
environment: gcc requires gcc-runtime, which it produces.

## Toolchain
The toolchain is gcc (with its gcc-runtime output), binutils and the
kernel headers (linux-headers): the packages whose meta says `pipeline
toolchain`. It is built apart from the rest, and a build is one of two
kinds (`info`: `pipeline`):

* A toolchain build (`run --new --toolchain`) builds the toolchain
  packages only. Its compiler is the toolchain reference's gcc, or
  Fedora's without one; it builds on the glibc of a pos reference, a
  stored pos build, and never builds glibc. `./build reference` stores it
  as the toolchain reference of later builds, which records the pos
  reference it was built on.
* A pos build (`run --new`) builds every stage with the toolchain
  reference's toolchain, and never builds a toolchain package. Its own
  packages are all built from the checkout; the stages that list
  toolchain packages (sdk, and core-libs' gcc-runtime) are assembled with
  the toolchain reference's. Until it has built them, core-libs is the
  pos reference's: by default the one the toolchain was built on.
  `./build reference` stores its core-libs as the pos reference of later
  toolchain builds.

The interface between the two is a built pos: the toolchain tree builds
nothing of pos, and pos nothing of the toolchain (see "Reference builds").

A build without a toolchain reference uses Fedora's compiler, the
`gcc-host` profile, which provides `gcc`: it runs Fedora's gcc with
`/pos` ahead of `/usr` in its search (`gcc-host/env.sh`). gcc obsoletes
`gcc-host`, and a host or profile package a toolchain reference package
obsoletes is not available, so with a toolchain reference its gcc is the
compiler. A pos build without one is the bootstrap of the first pos
reference: it builds packages, not stages, and its glibc is built with
Fedora's kernel headers (`host-linux-headers`, which linux-headers
obsoletes). From nothing, POS is built in four builds:

    $ POS_TOOLCHAIN_REFERENCE=none ./build run --new glibc        # glibc by Fedora's gcc
    $ ./build reference                                           # the first pos reference
    $ POS_TOOLCHAIN_REFERENCE=none ./build run --new --toolchain  # by Fedora's gcc
    $ ./build reference
    $ ./build run --new --toolchain                               # by itself
    $ ./build reference
    $ ./build run --new                                           # the stages
    $ ./build reference                                           # pos reference of later toolchains

The second toolchain build is the one released: its gcc is built by a POS
gcc of the same sources. The bootstrap glibc is only what the first
toolchains run on; the pos build builds glibc again with the toolchain's
kernel headers. A toolchain update is a toolchain build with the current
references, stored as the next toolchain reference.

A toolchain built on glibc N runs on glibc N or newer (symbol
versioning), so a toolchain is built on the oldest pos it serves, and a
glibc update in pos needs no toolchain build. A pos build may take a
newer pos reference than its toolchain was built on (`pos-reference`);
an older glibc is refused. libstdc++ (gcc-runtime) is configured against
the glibc it is built on: new glibc features reach it only with a
toolchain build.

The toolchain runs on glibc only. gcc builds gmp, mpfr and mpc in its tree
(`with-sources`) and links them statically, as it does libstdc++ and libgcc
(`--with-static-standard-libraries`); gcc and binutils use their bundled
zlib and no zstd. The gcc recipe fails if a compiler program needs another
library. So a pos build can change any library but glibc, whose ABI is
backward compatible, under the toolchain it builds with: the toolchain
reference's gcc runs on the pos build's glibc as soon as that is built. gmp and mpfr
are also pos packages, built from the same sources for coreutils and
gawk; mpc is only built in gcc's tree (`kind source`).

gcc-runtime (libstdc++, libgcc_s) ships in core-libs but is an output of
the gcc build, so the C++ headers a program is compiled with and the
libstdc++ it runs on always come from the same gcc.

`util-linux-bootstrap` breaks a cycle with a bootstrap package: it is
util-linux without libsystemd; systemd requires it, and
util-linux requires systemd. util-linux provides its name and obsoletes it,
so once util-linux is built it replaces util-linux-bootstrap everywhere.
Its `build.sh` sources the main recipe after setting `configure_extra`,
which the main recipe appends to its configure arguments, where the later
flag wins (`--without-systemd`).

## Build containers
Every step of a build (preparing a source, building a package, making an
output) runs in a podman container of its own, except what an output
does with the host's podman (see "Build outputs"). A package build sees
two things:

* `/usr`: the build's tools image, `localhost/pos-tools:<id>`, made when the
  build is created (`buildsys/tools.containerfile`). It is the `tools-image`
  setting, Fedora's container image by default, pulled then and pinned by
  digest (`info`: `tools-base`), with the `host-requires` and
  `prepare-requires` of every package and the `host-requires` of every
  output installed by dnf.
  Nothing installs while a build runs, so every step of a run sees the
  same tools whatever order they run in. When a package declares more
  later in the build, the image is made again on the same base
  (`tools-packages` lists what it has). What a step uses from Fedora must
  be declared (`host-base` for every build): the base image has little
  more than bash, coreutils and dnf.
* `/pos`: the package's resolved environment, composed for this build: the
  staging trees of the POS packages in it (this build's `dest/<name>`, or
  a reference's), hard-linked into `roots/<package>`, mounted read-only.
  A path has one owner: composing fails when two packages of the
  environment ship the same file or link. The root is removed after the
  build, and kept when it fails, to look at.

A requirement the package does not declare is not there, so the build
fails instead of picking it up from whatever else is installed. Of the
checkout, a step sees only what it uses, at the host's paths: a package
build the recipes (`buildsys`, the trees' `packages`) and its source tree read-only,
and the build's `build`, `dest` and `debug` directories. A step runs as the
caller, with `HOME=/tmp`, `LC_ALL=C` and no network. Preparing has
network, and an output runs as the container's root (the caller outside
it) with network: for dnf and Fedora's kernel, and `pos-fedora`'s Fedora
provides. It sees the recipes (`buildsys`, `outputs`, the stage lists) and the
build directory.

A built package's staging tree carries its metadata in
`/pos/lib/pos/packages/<name>/`: `meta` (the package's meta, the build
ID, the packages it was built against, the tools image ID and the
reference builds) and `files`. The metadata stays in the stage archives, so
an installed `/pos` records what it contains.

`./build clean` removes the tools image; a later `run` makes it again.

## Reference builds
A reference build is a stored build of the other pipeline. There are two
kinds:

* A toolchain reference is a toolchain build: the toolchain packages. Its
  packages are available to the resolver as `<name>@ref`. Where no
  package of the build provides a capability, the reference's copy does,
  if the capability is a stand-in one (one that a package another
  obsoletes provides: the reference's gcc stands in for `gcc-host`), or,
  in a pos build, if no target of the run provides it. A pos build does
  not build the toolchain packages, so they are always the reference's.
* A pos reference is a pos build's core-libs: glibc and the libraries
  that link it. Its packages are `<name>@pos`, and provide what no package
  of the build does in a toolchain build, which builds no pos package, or,
  in a pos build, if no target of the run provides it. A run of a single
  package in a new pos build builds only that package, against the pos
  reference's core-libs; what it requires outside core-libs must be among
  the targets.

A reference package's own requirements are those it was built with (its
recorded meta). They are met by this build's packages once built,
otherwise by the references', targets or not: the toolchain reference's
gcc requires glibc, and builds it, running on the pos reference's glibc
until then. Where a package is ready with a reference's copy of a
package the run builds, it waits while another is ready without one, so
the toolchain build builds binutils with its own linux-headers, though
it builds it with the reference's gcc.

`./build reference [<id>]` (default: the current build) stores a build in
the reference store, the `reference-dir` setting, as
`pos-ref-toolchain-<id>.tar.zst` or `pos-ref-pos-<id>.tar.zst`: its
`info` and the staging trees and debug info of what it stores. Of a toolchain build, which must be complete, that is
its toolchain packages; of a pos build, its core-libs packages, which
must include glibc. It marks the build the store's `default-toolchain` or
`default-pos`, the reference of that kind of new builds (a store's
`default` from before pos references counts as `default-toolchain`). A
build records its references in `info` (`toolchain-reference`,
`pos-reference`) and restores them from the store into
`work/references/<id>` when they are not there, checking that each is of
its kind; an archive named `pos-ref-<id>.tar.zst`, from before the kinds
had names of their own, is read as either. The store is a directory
outside the checkout, so removing builds never removes a reference.

A pos build's pos reference is, by default, the one its toolchain
reference was built on (`pos-reference` in the reference's `info`); the
`pos-reference` setting can name a newer one, as long as its glibc is
not older (`include/features.h`). A toolchain reference from before pos
references holds glibc as well, which is not used: it was built on that
glibc, and a pos build with it needs `pos-reference` set.

Comparing a pos build made with a toolchain built from nothing to one
made with a later toolchain (`devtools/compare-builds.sh`: the files of
each package and the libraries every ELF file links against) shows what
the build environment leaked into a package.

## Build setup
`pkg_setup` has no build strategy of its own. A package that changes how
others are built has an `env.sh`, and `pkg_setup` sources the `env.sh` of
every package in the resolved requirements. What a build gets therefore
follows from what it requires, never from what is found on disk:

* `gcc/env.sh`: the POS compiler, `/pos/bin/gcc`, `g++` and `ld`.
* `host-toolchain/env.sh` and `gcc-host/env.sh`: the Fedora compiler,
  searching `/pos` ahead of `/usr` (`gcc-host`, standing in for gcc).
* `pos-link/env.sh`: link against `/pos` with the build's compiler.

`pos-link` and `gcc-host` are profiles (`kind profile`): nothing is built
or installed, they only carry the setup and its requirements. Recipes
build-require `gcc` and `pos-link`, which requires `gcc`. glibc requires
only the compiler (see "Core libs stage"); linux-headers only
`host-gcc`, for the one program its build runs.

Requirements are what a build sees, but configure scripts also find what
they were not asked to. gcc's run-time requirements (glibc, gcc-runtime,
binutils, linux-headers) are in every build that uses it, and gcc-host's
Fedora compiler falls back to the tools image's `/usr`. A package that
links a library must require it.

## Build flags
`pkg_setup` sets the flags every package is built with (`pkg_flags`), as
Fedora's and Arch's package builds do, before the `env.sh` files add to
them:

* `CFLAGS`: `-O2 -g -pipe`, and the hardening `-fexceptions
  -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 -fstack-clash-protection -fcf-protection`, with
  frame pointers (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer`)
  for profilers. `CXXFLAGS` adds `-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS`.
* `LDFLAGS`: `-Wl,-O1 -Wl,--as-needed -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now
  -Wl,--build-id=sha1`.
* PIE and `-fstack-protector-strong` are the POS compiler's defaults
  (`--enable-default-pie --enable-default-ssp`), and it gives every link
  a build ID (`--enable-linker-build-id`). Fedora's compiler, used in a
  build without a toolchain reference, does both through its own
  defaults.

meson builds use `--buildtype=plain` and cmake builds
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None`, so these flags are the only ones; meson's
`release` would have added `-O3` and no debug info. Warnings are not made
errors (no `-Werror=format-security`): POS builds upstream's development
branches.

glibc and gcc keep
only `-O2 -g -pipe` (`pos_optflags`). glibc has its own hardening options
and builds parts of itself without the stack protector; gcc derives the
flags of its target libraries (libgcc, libstdc++) from `CFLAGS`. glibc
also gets no `LDFLAGS`; it links itself by its own rules.

CET (`-fcf-protection`) only takes effect when every object of a link
has it, including glibc's `crt1.o` and `crti.o` and gcc's `crtbegin*.o`.
glibc is configured `--enable-cet` (its default follows the compiler's,
which is off); gcc enables it in its target libraries by itself.

## Debug info
`pkg_finish` strips what a package installs and keeps the debug info
separately (`pkg_strip`), as Fedora's debuginfo packages do. Each ELF
program and shared library's debug info is copied to
`work/builds/<id>/debug/<package>/pos/lib/debug/.build-id/<xx>/<rest>.debug`,
named by its build ID, where gdb and debuginfod look for it; the file in
`dest/<package>` is then stripped. The loader keeps its symbol table
(valgrind needs it), static libraries lose only their debug info, and
object files (`crt*.o`) are left as they are. A file without a build ID is
stripped with a warning in the log. Set-uid bits, modes and hard links are
kept.

The debug trees are not part of build roots. Each stage's is
archived next to it as `pos-debug-<stage>-<stem>.tar.zst`, which extracts
on top of the stage into `/pos/lib/debug`, and the RPM outputs make it the
`pos-debuginfo` and `pos-sdk-debuginfo` packages. gdb looks in `/usr/lib/debug` unless told
otherwise, and reads the directory before it loads the program:

    $ gdb -iex 'set debug-file-directory /usr/lib/debug:/pos/lib/debug' /pos/bin/bash

# Prefix
`/pos` is the prefix for everything POS ships: the base system, and optional
components such as the SDK. It stays read-only for the whole lifetime of an
installation. An update replaces the tree. Programs, libraries, headers, and
shipped data that POS provides install there. Programs in `/pos` have no
dependencies outside the prefix.

Third-party applications install in separate hierarchy. A machine can keep `/usr` for that, or any other prefix.

Configuration and mutable data stay outside the prefix:

* `/etc` is local configuration.
* `/var` is variable data.
* `/run` is runtime state.

Every package is configured with `--sysconfdir=/etc` and, where it applies,
`--localstatedir=/var` (`$sysconfdir` and `$localstatedir` in `buildsys/pkg.sh`).
There is no `/pos/etc` or `/pos/var`. glibc only rewrites those paths to
`/etc` and `/var` when its prefix is `/usr`, so with `--prefix=/pos` the
flags have to be passed explicitly. Files a package installs into `etc/` or
`var/` at build time are shipped defaults, so `pkg_finish` moves them to
`/pos/share/factory`, and write a tmpfiles.d file of the package,
`/pos/lib/tmpfiles.d/factory-<package>.conf`, with a `C` line for each:
`systemd-tmpfiles` copies a file into place where it is missing, at every
boot and when an image is made (`fs_factory`). glibc's nss_db helper is one of them: it
is installed as `/var/db/Makefile` and generates the `.db` files there from
`/etc`. Packages that have a separate vendor directory (pam's `vendordir`)
ship their defaults there instead. `DESTDIR` is only the staging directory
under `work/` used at install time. It is not part of the running system.

Packages assume `/usr` in places `--prefix` does not reach. Two ways to
handle it: a configure option that moves the path (preferred, it keeps the
binary self-contained), or a symlink from the hardcoded path back into
`/pos`. Symlinks live in the root filesystem, outside any package, so they
are part of the root layout an image stage creates; a package never installs
outside `/pos` (`buildsys/build.sh` warns on it).

* systemd: units, generators and `systemd-*` binaries are searched relative
  to `--prefix`. The programs it execs default to `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`
  and are moved with the `*-path` options (`-Dkmod-path=/pos/bin/kmod`,
  `-Dmount-path`, `-Dsulogin-path`, ...). Its `pam.d` files go to
  `-Dpamconfdir=/pos/share/pam/pam.d`, the vendor directory POS pam reads;
  pam's other fallback, `/usr/lib/pam.d`, is hardcoded.
* systemd-tmpfiles: a `C` line without a source argument copies from
  `/usr/share/factory/`. That path is hardcoded. POS's lines give the
  source explicitly (`C /etc/foo - - - - /pos/share/factory/etc/foo`); a
  root layout can also have `/usr/share/factory -> /pos/share/factory`,
  for third-party tmpfiles lines.
* os-release: `/etc/os-release` and `/usr/lib/os-release` are where the
  os-release specification and systemd (PID 1, hostnamed, nspawn, image
  dissection) look. POS's is `/pos/lib/os-release` (pos-integration);
  `/usr/lib/os-release` links to it, from an image's layout or from
  pos-fedora, and `/etc/os-release` to that, as systemd's tmpfiles.d
  `etc.conf` makes it.
* Shebangs and the kernel: `#!/bin/sh`, `#!/bin/bash`, `#!/usr/bin/env`,
  `/sbin/init`, and `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` for third-party binaries
  are the same class. Which of these the root layout provides as symlinks
  into `/pos` is decided per image (see "Images"), and for a machine it
  interacts with keeping its own `/usr`. The container image has them all.
* systemd's drop-in directories (`tmpfiles.d`, `sysusers.d`, `sysctl.d`,
  `modules-load.d`, `binfmt.d`, `udev/rules.d`, ...) and kernel-install's
  plugins are searched in `/etc`, `/run`, `/usr/local/lib` and `/usr/lib`.
  Its prepare recipe adds `/pos/lib` before `/usr/lib`, as units have the
  prefix before `/usr/lib`, so packages outside POS (Fedora's on a
  `pos-fedora` system, a kernel) are still read.
* kmod: `-Ddistconfdir=/pos/lib` for `modprobe.d`/`depmod.d`. Modules stay
  in `/usr/lib/modules`, where kernel packages install them: POS boots
  kernels other projects build. The kernel loads modules on demand with
  the modprobe its build names (`/usr/bin/modprobe` in Fedora's); kmod's
  `sysctl.d/50-kmod.conf` sets `kernel.modprobe` to `/pos/sbin/modprobe`.
* systemd: programs a unit names without a path, and the `PATH` of
  services and user sessions, are looked up in `/usr/local` and `/usr`, with
  `/pos/sbin:/pos/bin` appended (`-Dextra-exec-search-path`). sudo's
  `secure_path` is the same list.
* util-linux: `--enable-fs-paths-default=/pos/sbin` for mount helpers.
* shadow: `--enable-vendordir=/pos/share/factory/etc`, so login.defs is found
  before `/etc/login.defs` has been created. pam's vendordir
  (`/pos/share/pam`) could move to the same tree for consistency.
* qemu-ga: poweroff, halt, reboot, shutdown and hwclock are run by their
  `/sbin` paths, string constants with no configure option;
  `pos/system/packages/qemu/prepare.sh` points them at `/pos/sbin`.
* logrotate: `--with-compress-command=/pos/bin/gzip`. Tool paths found by
  configure are the general case: a build container finds `/usr/bin`
  tools and records those unless told otherwise (man-db's recipe shows the
  `--with-nroff=/pos/bin/nroff` pattern).
* systemd unit, tmpfiles and sysusers directories for packages built before
  systemd (util-linux): given explicitly as `/pos/lib/systemd/system`,
  `/pos/lib/tmpfiles.d`, `/pos/lib/sysusers.d`.

## Library directory
`/pos/lib` is the only library directory: the native x86-64 libraries, the
loader `/pos/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, and the architecture-independent
trees (`lib/systemd`, `lib/pos`). There is no `/pos/lib64`
and no multilib. This is the Arch and LFS layout, not Fedora's, where
`lib64` holds the 64-bit libraries and `lib` the 32-bit ones and the
architecture-independent files.

The upstream defaults assume Fedora's layout in a few places, which the
recipes override:

* gcc: `t-linux64` names `../lib64` for `-m64`; the recipe makes it
  `../lib`, and gcc is `--disable-multilib`.
* glibc: the x86-64 `ldd-rewrite.sed` turns the loader list into the
  `lib64`/`lib`/`libx32` set; `ldd-rewrite-script = no` in configparms keeps
  `RTLDLIST` at the installed loader.
* meson, cmake's GNUInstallDirs and Fedora's gcc see the build
  container's `/usr/lib64` and choose `lib64`; recipes built with them set libdir to
  `/pos/lib`. gcc is `--disable-libcc1`: libcc1 installs into the
  building compiler's multilib directory, which Fedora's g++ answers with
  `../lib64`.

`pkg_record` stops a build that installs into `pos/lib64`, `pos/lib32` or
`pos/libx32`; the POS loader would not find libraries there.

32-bit binaries are not built. 32-bit programs are applications 
(Steam, older Wine), outside the base system,
and can run from an install root of another distribution that ships
32-bit libraries. If POS ever ships an i686 compat set, it goes in
`/pos/lib32` with its loader at `/pos/lib32/ld-linux.so.2`; gcc then
gets multilib with `m64=../lib m32=../lib32`, and the glibc recipe writes
ldd's `RTLDLIST` itself.

# Set-uid programs
The staging install runs unprivileged, so `make install` cannot chown or set
set-uid bits (util-linux `--disable-makeinstall-chown --disable-makeinstall-setuid`,
sudo `install_uid=$(id -u)`). Recipes call `pkg_setuid` on the programs that
need it (su, mount, umount, chfn, chsh, passwd, chage, gpasswd, newgrp,
sudo, crontab, dbus-daemon-launch-helper); that sets mode 4755 in
the staging tree. `assemble.sh` records owner 0:0 in the archive, so
extracting it as root produces root-owned set-uid files. Anything that
installs the tree has to preserve modes (`tar -x` as root, or `cp -a`, not
`cp -r`; unprivileged `tar -x` needs `-p`).

# Core libs stage
Each package stages into `work/builds/<id>/dest/<name>` with `--prefix=/pos`.

With the sdk compiler, packages use `/pos/bin/gcc`, `/pos/bin/g++`, and
`/pos/bin/ld`, whose defaults already search `/pos/include` and `/pos/lib`,
and `pos-link` adds only
`-L/pos/lib` and `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`. No rpath: the POS loader finds
`/pos/lib` through its own cache or its default search path (below).
`/pos/include` must not be named again with `-isystem` or
`CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`. That moves it in front of the libstdc++ directories,
gcc drops the later duplicate, and libstdc++'s `#include_next <stdlib.h>`
finds nothing after itself (ncurses then falls back to `<iostream.h>`).

A build without a toolchain reference is built by the host toolchain.
Only there does `gcc-host` add `-isystem /pos/include`,
`C_INCLUDE_PATH`, `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`, and `LIBRARY_PATH` to put `/pos`
ahead of the host's `/usr`.

The POS loader and ldconfig use `/etc/pos/ld.so.cache` and
`/etc/pos/ld.so.conf`, not `/etc/ld.so.cache` and `/etc/ld.so.conf`. Those
belong to the loader of whatever else is on the machine: a `/usr` the
machine keeps, or Fedora in a build container. One cache listing both sets of
libraries makes each loader pick up the other's libc; in a toolbox the POS
loader found Fedora's `/lib64/libc.so.6` and every program without an rpath
crashed (gcc's libatomic configure runs one). The glibc recipe sets
`LD_SO_CACHE` and `LD_SO_CONF` in `configparms`. With no POS cache, as in a
build container, the loader searches `/pos/lib`. glibc ships
`/etc/pos/ld.so.conf` (`/pos/lib`) as a factory default, so ldconfig can
write the cache next to it; pos-fedora's adds `/usr/lib64`. dracut's
library lookup (dracut-install, and the cache it makes in the initramfs)
is changed by its recipe to read `/etc/pos/ld.so.conf` and search
`/pos/lib`, as the POS loader does.

Binaries carry no rpath. The loader searches the binary's RPATH/RUNPATH,
then `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, then its cache, then its default directory
(`/pos/lib`). The POS cache is built from `/pos/lib` and
`/etc/pos/ld.so.conf`, so it gives the same answer as the default; an rpath
would only repeat it. Library lookup is decided in one place: the cache and
`/etc/pos/ld.so.conf`.

glibc is built with the toolchain reference's gcc, which runs on the pos reference's glibc. This is the same arrangement
as Fedora: the gcc in `/usr` was linked against the installed libc, and it
compiles the glibc that will replace it. The compiler runs on the old libc.
The new one is a build output. glibc passes `-nostdlib -nostartfiles` and
names the build-tree `libc.so` and `ld.so` on the link line, then appends
its own `-Wl,-dynamic-linker=/pos/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`.

The extra search path other packages get stays off for this build: glibc
requires `gcc`, not `pos-link`. With `gcc-host`, in the bootstrap pos
build, it does get `/pos` in its search; there `/pos` is empty, and the
kernel headers glibc wants are Fedora's, in `/usr/include`
(`host-linux-headers`).
`C_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH` are not disabled by `-nostdinc` or
`-nostdlib`, and the `/pos` link flags are not ones glibc puts on its own
binaries. Fedora gets the header isolation from `--with-headers`, which
turns on `-nostdinc` and adds only the kernel headers. Our recipe does not
pass that, because the kernel headers and the installed glibc headers share
`/pos/include`.

In a build without a toolchain reference, the host gcc is still
visible and keeps `/usr/include` and `/usr/lib64` in its default search
after `/pos`. A configure check for a library that is not in `/pos` yet
then finds the tools image's copy, and the binary fails to load because the
POS loader searches only `/pos/lib`. A build that dies with exit 127 while
running its own freshly built program is this. Check with
`objdump -p <binary> | grep NEEDED`.

glibc installs C.UTF-8 as `/pos/lib/locale/C.utf8` (Fedora's
glibc-minimal-langpack has the same): programs that need a UTF-8 locale
fall back to it (tmux), and containers set it. The other UTF-8 locales of
glibc's `localedata/SUPPORTED` are compiled into one archive,
`/pos/lib/locale/locale-archive`, so any language works as it is;
the legacy character sets (ISO-8859-*, EUC-*, ...) are not built. glibc
reads compiled locales only from its own prefix, not Fedora's
`/usr/lib/locale`.

gmp and mpfr are in this stage. coreutils `expr` and `factor`, and gawk
`-M`, link them at run time. gmp `--enable-cxx` needs libstdc++, from the
toolchain reference's gcc-runtime. The compiler has its own static copies (see
"Toolchain").

`ca-certificates` installs the Mozilla trusted root certificates as
`/pos/share/ca-certificates/ca-bundle.crt` and provides `/etc/ssl/cert.pem` and
`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` via the factory tree for OpenSSL and standard
tools. `tzdata` installs the IANA time zone database into `/pos/share/zoneinfo`
and the `zic`/`zdump` utilities.

`run` assembles each stage it was given into one archive,
`work/builds/<id>/pos-<stage>-<stem>.tar.zst`, with a top-level `pos/`
directory. The merged tree is left at `work/builds/<id>/assemble/<stage>/pos`.

# Build outputs
An output is what a build makes of its assembled stages: an image, a disk,
RPM packages. `outputs/<output>/` holds `meta`, which declares what it is
made from, and `output.sh`, its recipe (format in `buildsys/outputs.sh`):

    requires core-libs system
    host-requires rpm-build

`requires` names stages and other outputs: an output is made from the
stages of the build once they are assembled, and from what the outputs it
requires made (container-fs-dnf from the RPM packages of rpm-pos,
rpm-pos-sdk and rpm-pos-fedora; fedora-toolbox from container-fs-dnf).
`host-requires` are Fedora packages its steps need in the tools image.

| output | requires | makes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `container-fs` | core-libs, system, sdk | `pos-container-fs-<stem>.tar.zst` |
| `stage-images` | core-libs, system, network, container | `pos-<stage>-<stem>.raw` and `.requires` of network and container |
| `vm-disk` | core-libs, system, stage-images | `pos-vm-disk-<stem>.qcow2` |
| `rpm-pos` | core-libs, system | `rpm/pos`, `rpm/pos-debuginfo` |
| `rpm-pos-sdk` | sdk | `rpm/pos-sdk`, `rpm/pos-sdk-debuginfo` |
| `rpm-pos-fedora` | core-libs, system, sdk | `rpm/pos-fedora` |
| `container-fs-dnf` | the rpm-pos outputs | `pos-container-fs-dnf-<stem>.tar.zst` |
| `vm-disk-dnf` | the rpm-pos outputs | `pos-vm-disk-dnf-<stem>.qcow2` |
| `fedora-toolbox` | container-fs-dnf | `localhost/pos-fedora-toolbox` in podman |

`run` makes every output whose stages it assembled, directly or through
the outputs it requires, so a plain `run` makes them all. Each starts as
soon as what it requires is made, at the same time as the others that are
ready, and logs to `logs/output-<output>.log`; after a failure no more
start. `./build output [<output>...]` makes outputs of the current build
again (default: every output its assembled stages can make), from what
the build already has.

A recipe defines `output()`, which runs in a container of the build's
tools image as the container's root, with network (see "Build
containers"), and `output_host()`, which runs on the host after it, for
what needs the host's podman. Both call the functions of
`buildsys/output-plugins.d`: `fs.sh` makes a root tree and archives it,
`disk.sh` makes a disk of it and checks the disk, `rpm.sh` makes RPM
packages, `sysext.sh` makes stage images (see "Stage images") and
`podman.sh` builds and imports podman images. A recipe may
use another output's files: vm-disk-dnf takes vm-disk's `root/` and
`repart.d`.

## Images
An image is a root filesystem with POS installed, made by `fs.sh` in the
output's scratch directory, `output/<output>/root` of the build, and
archived as `pos-<output>-<stem>.tar.zst` (`fs_archive`) or made into a
disk (see "Disks"). `fs_stages` extracts the stage archives the output
requires into `/pos`, in order; `fs_layout` makes the root layout around
`/pos` from `outputs/<output>/layout`: directories with their modes, and
the symlinks into `/pos` for the paths in "Prefix". `fs_copy` copies the
files of a directory in, such as `outputs/vm-disk/root` (`/etc/kernel`,
the network).

`fs_factory` and `fs_sysusers` fill what a first boot would: the factory
tree's `C` lines are applied to `/etc` and `/var` by the image's own
`systemd-tmpfiles`, and `/etc/passwd`, `group`, `shadow` and `gshadow` are
created by POS `systemd-sysusers --root` from `/pos/lib/sysusers.d`. That
runs through the image's own loader, `pos/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
--library-path ...`, so `/pos` need not be installed where it runs.
Everything is owned by root in the archive. Group write, which build trees
pick up from the build directory, is removed except on sticky directories.

`container-fs` is core-libs, system and the sdk, for `podman import` or
`docker import`. It has no `/etc/pos/ld.so.cache`; the loader searches
`/pos/lib`. Programs are in `/pos/bin` and `/pos/sbin`, which are not in a
container engine's default `PATH`, so the import sets it:

    $ podman import \
        --change 'ENV PATH=/pos/bin:/pos/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin' \
        --change 'CMD ["/bin/bash"]' \
        work/builds/<id>/pos-container-fs-<stem>.tar.zst pos:<id>

`devtools/import-image.sh [-o <output>] [<id>]` does that, and tags the
image with the build's product version too (`pos:1.0`), the tag to make
containers from: it moves to whichever build of that version was imported last. An
output's name in podman (`tag`) and whether POS's programs come first in
`PATH` (`path-priority pos`) are in its `meta`. For an image made with
podman (see "Images made with podman"), which is in podman already, it
only sets the version tag.

`vm-disk` is a bootable POS system without an RPM layer: core-libs and
system, Fedora's kernel and a disk (see "Disks"). `fs_kernel` installs
Fedora kernel packages into a tree without rpm: it downloads them from
Fedora's repositories, unpacks them into the tree and runs POS's
kernel-install there, as Fedora's scriptlet does in vm-disk-dnf: its
plugins run depmod, POS's dracut, which makes the initramfs, and write the
boot loader entry (`root/etc/kernel`). The modules are in
`/usr/lib/modules`, with `/lib/modules` a link to it, the path kernel
packages and dracut use.

## Images made with dnf
`fs_dnf` makes the tree with `dnf --installroot`: POS as the base of an
RPM system (see "RPM packages"). A package named `pos` or `pos-*` is the
build's own RPM file (`pos`, `pos-sdk`, `pos-fedora` and their debuginfo),
anything else comes from Fedora's repositories. Next to the output's
artifact, `pos-<output>-<stem>.packages` lists the packages installed. The
tree's files belong to users the packages create, which only the
container's root can remove: the scratch directory is removed in the
container when the output is made.

The root layout comes from Fedora's `filesystem` and `setup` packages and
pos-fedora's links; users and groups are created by rpm from the packages'
sysusers definitions. No package creates `/tmp` (on Fedora,
systemd-tmpfiles and the image builders do), so fs_dnf makes it. The
recipes apply the factory tree's `C` lines too (`fs_factory`), as a boot
would: dnf installs none of POS's files outside `/pos`. `/etc/os-release`
is POS's (pos-fedora's links). Files copied in before (`fs_copy`) are
there for the packages' scriptlets to read.

The scriptlets run in the root as on a running system: dnf runs with
`/proc`, `/sys` and `/dev` mounted in the root, and a file system of its
own at `/boot`, as the ESP is when the system runs. The mounts are in a
mount namespace of the step's container (which runs as the container's
root, allowed to mount there) and are gone when dnf is done; what was
written to `/boot` is kept in the tree.

`container-fs-dnf` is `pos`, `pos-sdk`, `pos-fedora` and `dnf`: a
container with POS as its base in which `dnf install` adds Fedora
packages, which use POS for what it replaces:

    $ devtools/import-image.sh -o container-fs-dnf
    $ podman run --rm -it pos-dnf
    # dnf install htop

`vm-disk-dnf` is container-fs-dnf's packages and Fedora's kernel
(`kernel-core`, `kernel-modules`): a bootable system. POS boots kernels
other projects build; Fedora's kernel package installs as on Fedora. Its
scriptlet runs POS's kernel-install (vm-disk's `root/etc/kernel`: Type #1
boot loader entries, the kernel command line), whose plugins are POS's
(depmod, the loader entry, and dracut's, which makes the initramfs from
POS's systemd, udev and libraries). The kernel, initramfs and entry are in
`/boot`.

## Disks
`disk_make` makes the tree a disk, `pos-<output>-<stem>.qcow2`: the
image's own systemd-boot is installed into `/boot` (POS `bootctl
install`), then `systemd-repart` makes the partitions of a `repart.d` and
fills them from the tree, without loop devices or privileges. The
partitions have the discoverable partition types, so systemd finds them
by type: no fstab and no `root=` on the kernel command line. vm-disk's
`repart.d`, which vm-disk-dnf uses too, is a 1G ESP (vfat) with `/boot`'s
contents, mounted at `/boot`, and an 8G root (ext4) with the rest. The
disk is a compressed qcow2 image (systemd-repart's raw disk converted with
`qemu-img`), which qemu and libvirt boot as it is; how to run it is up to
whoever uses it. `qemu-img convert -O raw` gives a raw disk.

The root grows to the disk it is on. vm-disk's `root/etc/repart.d` has a
definition of the root partition without a maximum size, so
systemd-repart, at every boot, grows it into the free space after it, and
systemd-growfs-root grows its file system (GPT flag 59, which repart sets
on the root by default). A copy made bigger before its first boot
(`qemu-img resize <copy> 40G`), or later, is used whole after the next
boot. vm.sh's overlay is 4G bigger than the disk, and smoke.sh checks that
the root fills it.

The disk boots with UEFI firmware only: it has no BIOS boot code, so a
BIOS (SeaBIOS, libvirt's default) stops at "Booting from Hard Disk". In
libvirt, choose UEFI without Secure Boot (virt-manager: customize before
install, Firmware `OVMF_CODE.fd`, not a `secboot` one; virt-install:
`--boot uefi,firmware.feature0.name=secure-boot,firmware.feature0.enabled=no`),
since systemd-boot and the kernels are not signed. Libvirt writes to the
disk it is given; give it a copy.

The kernel command line (vm-disk's `root/etc/kernel/cmdline`) is
`console=ttyS0 console=tty0`. Kernel messages show on both; the last one,
the display, is `/dev/console`, where systemd shows its status and the
first boot's questions. Each has a login prompt: getty@tty1 on the display,
and a serial getty that systemd's getty generator starts for the serial
console. On the first boot systemd-firstboot asks for the timezone (UTC is
filled in) and the root password, which is how root gets one; locale and
keymap are not asked, as systemd-firstboot asks only where there is a
choice. Systemd credentials answer the questions instead
(`passwd.hashed-password.root`, `firstboot.timezone`, see
systemd-firstboot(1)); libvirt passes them as SMBIOS type 11 strings, as
vm.sh does.

`devtools/vm.sh [-o <output>] [<id>]` boots a disk in qemu with KVM and
UEFI firmware, in a container of `localhost/pos-vm` (Fedora with qemu
and OVMF, made when missing), on the serial console of the terminal
(Ctrl-a x quits), which it makes `/dev/console` by appending
`console=ttyS0` and `systemd.firstboot=no` to the command line. The disk
is not changed: the VM writes to an overlay that is gone when it stops. Root is logged in on the console by a getty
drop-in passed as a systemd credential, so no password is set. The VM
has qemu's user mode network: dnf works inside.

`vm.sh -c <script>` runs a script in the VM instead, without a console:
the script and a unit that runs it go in as credentials (the unit as
`systemd.extra-unit`, pulled in by `systemd.wants` on the command line),
it runs as root once the boot transaction is done, writes to a second
serial port that vm.sh prints, and the VM powers off. vm.sh exits with the
script's status; the console goes to `logs/vm-<output>.log` of the build.
`devtools/smoke.sh` is the check of a booted image: system state, failed
units, module loading in the initrd and after, unit file modes, the login
prompt on tty1, the QEMU guest agent, network and dnf, the PAM services
and sudo. Its status is the number of failed checks. `disk_check` runs it in `output_host()` (see "Build numbers").

## Stage images
An optional stage (network, container) ships with an installed system without being
part of its `/pos`: as a system extension image in the system's library
of stage images, which `pos-stage` enables. The stage arrives built, from
the same build as the rest, and nothing is downloaded or integrated on
the machine; enabling it runs only what a first boot runs for its files.

* `stage-images` makes the image of a stage with `sysext_stage`
  (`buildsys/output-plugins.d/sysext.sh`): `pos-<stage>-<stem>.raw`, an
  EROFS file system (lz4hc) of the stage's `/pos`, with
  `/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.pos-<stage>`. Its `ID`
  and `SYSEXT_LEVEL` are those of the base stages' os-release (system's),
  where assemble.sh writes the build's identifier as `SYSEXT_LEVEL`:
  systemd-sysext merges an image only onto the build it was made with.
* Stages depend on stages, not on packages. `sysext_stage` writes the
  stages an image needs besides the base, `pos-<stage>-<stem>.requires`:
  those whose member lists name a run-time requirement of the stage's
  packages (their installed meta). The container stage requires network
  (netavark requires nftables); nothing is declared twice.
* `fs_stage_images` (fs.sh) puts the images into an image's library,
  `/pos/lib/pos/stages/pos-<stage>.raw` with `pos-<stage>.requires`.
  vm-disk has one, so it is made once the optional stages are assembled
  too.
* `pos-stage` (`/pos/sbin`, pos-integration) enables a stage: it links the
  image into `/etc/extensions`, and the images of the stages it requires
  first, runs `systemd-sysext refresh`, which merges
  the enabled images over `/pos` read-only and reloads systemd, then
  `systemd-sysusers`, `systemd-tmpfiles --create` (the stage's factory
  files) and `ldconfig`. `pos-stage disable` removes the link and merges
  again, unless an enabled stage requires the stage; `pos-stage list`
  shows the library, with what each stage requires. systemd-sysext.service merges
  the enabled images at every boot, before tmpfiles runs; the stage's
  users were made when it was enabled and stay in `/etc/passwd`.
  Services a stage brings are not enabled: that is left to the
  administrator (`systemctl enable --now sshd`).
* systemd-sysext merges `/usr` and `/opt` unless `SYSTEMD_SYSEXT_HIERARCHIES`
  says otherwise. pos-integration's drop-in for systemd-sysext.service, and
  pos-stage, set it to `/pos`. The images' `/usr` (the extension-release)
  is not merged: `/usr` stays writable (`/usr/lib/modules`). The drop-in
  applies wherever POS's systemd runs, a pos-fedora system too, where it
  keeps Fedora's own extensions of `/usr` from merging; there the tools of
  the optional stages are Fedora's (see "RPM packages").
* An update replaces the library with the base, so an enabled stage stays
  the build's: the link in `/etc/extensions` names the library's path.
  smoke.sh enables the network stage and runs its tools where the library
  is, then the container stage, and runs containers.

## Images made with podman
`podman_build` makes an image with podman from the output's
`containerfile`, on top of the image of another output, which it requires.
It imports that output's archive into podman under its `tag`
(container-fs-dnf: `localhost/pos-dnf:<id>`) and builds on it, as `BASE`.
The result exists only in podman's local store, tagged with the build ID
and with the build's product version (`localhost/pos-fedora-toolbox:1.0`),
which moves to the build that made the image last. Builds made by other users
are in their own podman stores. `devtools/import-image.sh` imports the
other images of a build into podman the same way, or moves the version tag
back to an earlier build.

`fedora-toolbox` is container-fs-dnf as a toolbox image,
`localhost/pos-fedora-toolbox`, for working in a POS-based toolbox; builds
do not use it. It adds what toolbox needs and nothing installs:
toolbox puts its user in `wheel` with an empty password and runs sudo, so
the image adds a `wheel` rule in `/etc/sudoers.d` to POS's `/etc/sudoers`
(from the factory tree), which has none. sudo's PAM configuration is
POS's (see "System integration"). From Fedora's toolbox image it installs
with dnf: `flatpak-spawn` (toolbox run inside a toolbox, and `./build`,
reach the host with it), `p11-kit-client` (the host's trust store and smart
cards), `xorg-x11-xauth` (X11 programs on the host's display), nano as the
default editor and bash completion. Other tools are installed with dnf as
needed.

A toolbox stays on the image it was made from: moving to a later build is
making the toolbox again, from the image of that build.

    $ toolbox create -i localhost/pos-fedora-toolbox:<product version> <name>
    $ devtools/import-image.sh -o fedora-toolbox <id>   # back to build <id>

# RPM packages (experimental)
The outputs rpm-pos, rpm-pos-sdk and rpm-pos-fedora make the RPM packages
of the build's assembled stages, when `run` assembles their stages or with
`./build output rpm-pos rpm-pos-sdk rpm-pos-fedora`. Each recipe says what
its packages are; `buildsys/output-plugins.d/rpm.sh` has what they share:
`rpm_stages` packages the merged trees of the output's stages (`pos`,
`pos-sdk` and their debug info), `rpm_spec_head` and `rpm_build` make a
package of a spec, which rpm-pos-fedora writes itself. They are versioned with the build ID and written to
`work/builds/<id>/rpm`. dnf installs them as files, next to packages from
Fedora's repositories:

    $ sudo dnf --installroot=<root> --releasever=44 --use-host-config \
        install work/builds/<id>/rpm/pos{,-sdk,-fedora}-1.0.0-1.main.202610171524.x86_64.rpm dnf

* `pos` is the `/pos` tree of the stages other than sdk: the OS, as one
  package. It installs nothing outside `/pos` and provides nothing Fedora
  packages require, so it installs on any Fedora system without touching
  it, and is removed again with dnf.
* `pos-sdk` is the `/pos` tree of the sdk stage, and requires `pos` of the
  same build.
* `pos-debuginfo` and `pos-sdk-debuginfo` are the debug info of each in
  `/pos/lib/debug` (see "Debug info"); made when the build has any.
* `pos-fedora` makes a Fedora hybrid: it requires `pos` and `pos-sdk`
  (the systems it is for build with POS) and stands in for the Fedora
  packages POS replaces. On a system built with it, dnf resolves Fedora
  packages against POS and installs only what POS does not have.

`devtools/try-rpm.sh` tries them out in a throwaway toolbox: `pos` next to
Fedora, or a root with POS as its base and Fedora packages on top, run
with podman:

    $ devtools/try-rpm.sh root vim-minimal curl
    $ devtools/try-rpm.sh run ldd /usr/bin/curl
    $ devtools/try-rpm.sh clean

`outputs/rpm-pos-fedora/fedora` lists the Fedora packages POS replaces,
by POS package; a line counts when its POS package is in the stages. For
those, pos-fedora:

* provides what they provide, as Fedora's repositories list it, at
  Fedora's versions: names, `name(x86-64)`, `config()`, `rtld(GNU_HASH)`,
  `user()` and `group()`. rpm creates their system users from the last
  ones when pos-fedora is installed. Their sonames and paths are not copied.
* provides the sonames and symbol versions of the POS libraries, made by
  rpm's own generator from the POS files, so a Fedora binary that needs a
  version POS does not have stays unresolved instead of failing to load.
* conflicts with them, so dnf picks pos-fedora for their names and an
  existing Fedora system is not changed by accident. pos-fedora is for
  building a system, not for converting one.
* links the POS programs into `/usr/bin` (Fedora's `/usr/sbin` and `/bin`
  are links to it) and the libraries and the loader into `/usr/lib64`, and
  provides the `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin` and `/lib64` names of them.
  Fedora binaries request `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, so they run on
  POS glibc. A path that only Fedora packages pos-fedora does not replace
  have is not linked, so those install next to it.

The optional stages (network) have no RPM package, and pos-fedora claims
none of their packages: on an RPM system, Fedora's curl, openssh, iproute
and the others install in `/usr` as on Fedora. The stages are for native
systems, as images (see "Stage images").

A claim stands only if POS has every versioned soname and symbol version
the Fedora package provides; otherwise rpm-pos-fedora drops it with a warning
(listed in `rpm/pos-fedora.unmet`). Packages whose ABI differs from Fedora's
are left out of that list with the reason, and Fedora's copy is
installed next to POS where something needs it (OpenSSL 3 beside POS
OpenSSL 4).

Fedora packages installed next to POS put their libraries in `/usr/lib64`,
which the POS loader does not search by default. pos-fedora ships
`/etc/pos/ld.so.conf` (`/pos/lib`, then `/usr/lib64`) and runs
`/pos/sbin/ldconfig` after every package that adds libraries there or in
`/pos/lib`, so a later package's scriptlets find them. `/etc/ld.so.conf`,
which Fedora's glibc ships, links to it: tools that read the library path
there (dracut's) see the POS loader's.

dracut is POS's (in the system stage, with GNU cpio): pos-fedora stands in
for Fedora's. Its configuration (`/pos/lib/dracut/dracut.conf.d/01-dist.conf`,
from `pos/system/packages/dracut`) names POS's directories of systemd, udev and dbus,
and the library directories, so an initramfs is made from POS's systemd.
The same dracut makes the initramfs when an image is made and on a running
system, through kernel-install.

rpmbuild's defaults are for Fedora's `/usr`, and every spec turns them off:
automatic dependencies (they would make `pos` provide `libc.so.6()(64bit)`
and replace Fedora without pos-fedora), and the post-install steps
(stripping, debug info, `/usr/lib/.build-id` links, man page compression,
shebang rewriting; the build strips and keeps debug info itself, see
"Debug info"). Modes come from the staging trees, with group write
removed as in images; set-uid bits are kept. `License` is `NOASSERTION`:
package metadata records no license yet. No source RPMs are made;
`--source-archives` covers the sources.

POS systemd reads units and drop-ins from `/pos/lib` and from `/usr/lib`,
where Fedora packages install them (see "Prefix"); generators only from
`/pos/lib/systemd`. Not covered yet: the POS compiler does not search
`/usr/include`, so Fedora `-devel` packages and the compiler are not
replaced.

# SDK
The sdk stage (`pos/sdk/stage`) is the compiler, the assembler and linker, and the kernel UAPI
headers (linux-headers, binutils, gcc), plus developer tools moved out
of the system stage (diffutils, patch, man-pages). The first three are
the toolchain, built by toolchain builds (see "Toolchain"); a pos build
assembles the stage with its toolchain reference's. The sdk is a component POS
ships, so it installs under `/pos` like the base system. A base system
image does not include it; the builds of other packages require it.
The headers are needed only while compiling: glibc's `errno.h` includes
`<linux/errno.h>`, and nothing loads them at run time.

linux-headers is built from `pos/toolchain/src/linux`, mainline's `master`, synced as the
subset of the kernel tree that `make headers_install` needs: the top-level
`Makefile`, `scripts/`, `include/uapi/`, x86's `Makefile`, `include/uapi/`
and system call tables, and the licenses. The subset was checked by
comparing its installed headers with those of the whole tree. The recipe
builds out of tree (`O=`), so the source stays as committed. UAPI headers
are compatible with older kernels, so headers from mainline work on the
kernel a machine runs.

binutils is what makes the sdk compiler self-contained. gcc execs `as` and
`ld`; without POS copies it would run the build container's, whose ld
searches `/usr/lib64` on its own. binutils is configured
`--with-lib-path=/pos/lib` so ld searches only `/pos/lib`, and gcc is given
`--with-as=/pos/bin/as --with-ld=/pos/bin/ld`.

The compiler's own programs (cc1, cc1plus, lto1) are ordinary `/pos`
binaries, built without gcc's own staged bootstrap (`--disable-bootstrap`)
with the usual `/pos` link flags, running under the POS loader against
`/pos` glibc alone: gmp, mpfr, mpc, libstdc++ and libgcc are linked in
statically (see "Toolchain"). Built by Fedora's g++, that is Fedora's
`libstdc++.a` (`libstdc++-static`, which `gcc-host` installs). gcc's
top-level configure derives `CFLAGS_FOR_TARGET` from `CFLAGS`, which the
gcc recipes set to `-O2 -g -pipe` only (see "Build flags"), so the
hardening flags do not reach the target libraries; those are built by the
new xgcc with the patched defaults.

The run-time libraries are the gcc-runtime output of the gcc build:
libgcc_s, libstdc++, libatomic (the compiler links it by default and
libstdc++ depends on it) and libgomp. C and C++ programs need them at run
time, so gcc-runtime is in the core-libs stage and a base system has them
without the compiler. The split follows Fedora's libgcc, libstdc++,
libatomic and libgomp packages: gcc-runtime holds the `lib*.so.N` files
programs load, and the libstdc++ gdb pretty-printers. Everything used only
when compiling or linking stays in gcc: the C++ headers, the compiler's own
directory `lib/gcc/<target>/<version>` (crt files, `libgcc.a`, `unwind.h`,
`omp.h`), the static libraries (Fedora's `-static` packages), the
unversioned `lib*.so` names the linker looks up, `libgomp.spec` and
`libstdc++.modules.json`. The `.la` files are deleted, as Fedora does.

The compiler searches `/pos/include` as its system header directory, so gcc
requires linux-headers even though they are not part of the core-libs
archive.

The sdk archive ships the gcc of the toolchain reference, a toolchain build made
with the previous toolchain. Two toolchain builds in a row from the same
sources should produce the same compiler; comparing them would be the
check gcc's own `make bootstrap` does. The pos package gmp is
`--enable-fat` because the archive is installed on other machines; gcc's
copy is built for gcc's own host triplet, generic x86-64.


# System stage
The system stage (`pos/system/stage`) is init, the service manager, the login and account tools,
and the shell userland. It builds on core-libs.

* Left out for now: man-db with its groff, gdbm and libpipeline
  dependencies (a page viewer that costs four packages; each package still
  installs its man pages under `/pos/share/man`). Their recipes remain in
  `pos/system/packages/` for reuse.
* file and which are user utilities in the base. GNU which is the GNU
  project's git tree on Savannah, with its build system in the cwm4
  submodule; `pos/system/packages/which/prepare.sh` notes what its bootstrap needs.
* procps has the programs of Fedora's procps-ng: ps, top, free, pgrep,
  hugetop, pkill, pidof, pidwait, pmap, pwdx, skill, snice, slabtop, sysctl,
  tload, uptime, vmstat, w and watch, and libproc2. `w` reads sessions from
  logind. Its translated man pages are made by po4a (a host requirement),
  which leaves out those less than 80% translated.
* The QEMU guest agent (qemu-ga, pos/system/packages/qemu-guest-agent) answers the
  host's libvirt in a VM: guest IP addresses, `virsh guestinfo`, shutdown
  and reboot through the agent, file system freeze for quiesced snapshots,
  setting the clock and passwords. Its unit is qemu's, started by a udev
  rule of pos-integration when the VM has the agent's port
  (`org.qemu.guest_agent.0`, which virt-manager and vm.sh add), so it does
  nothing elsewhere. QEMU is synced as a subset of its tree, without the
  firmware submodules and prebuilt firmware, and only the agent is built:
  configure runs offline (`--disable-download`) with keycodemapdb, the one
  subproject it checks for, fetched by `pos/system/packages/qemu/prepare.sh`, and
  configure's Python packages from the build host. glib, its library, is
  built from git with gvdb as a submodule; its Python code generators
  (gdbus-codegen, glib-mkenums, glib-genmarshal, gtester-report) are not
  shipped, POS has no Python. SPICE's vdagent is left out: clipboard and display resizing
  need a graphical session.

## Overlapping binaries
Several programs are shipped by more than one project. Fedora and LFS pick
differently; POS follows Fedora except where noted.

| program | providers | POS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| login, su, nologin, sulogin, runuser | util-linux, shadow | util-linux; shadow `--without-su`, login/nologin deleted |
| chfn, chsh | util-linux, shadow | util-linux; shadow's deleted |
| vipw, vigr, newgrp | util-linux, shadow | shadow (sg has no other provider); util-linux `--disable-vipw --disable-newgrp` |
| groups | coreutils, shadow | coreutils; shadow's deleted |
| kill | util-linux, coreutils, procps, bash builtin | util-linux; coreutils `--enable-no-install-program=kill`; procps `--disable-kill` |
| uptime | coreutils, procps | procps; coreutils leaves it out |
| pidof | procps, sysvinit | procps (Fedora) |
| hostname | coreutils (off by default), systemd hostnamectl | coreutils `--enable-install-program=hostname` |
| lastlog | shadow (deprecated), util-linux lastlog2 | util-linux lastlog2 with pam_lastlog2; shadow default off |
| sh | bash, dash | bash (Fedora, Arch). One shell in the base; dash is an option later |
| awk | gawk, mawk | gawk (Fedora, Arch), including `-M` via core-libs gmp and mpfr |
| pager | less, more (util-linux) | both; less is what man and systemd call |
| bus daemon | dbus-daemon, dbus-broker | reference dbus-daemon for now. Fedora and Arch run dbus-broker; revisit when the base boots |
| privilege | sudo, systemd run0, su | sudo shipped as planned; run0 comes with systemd anyway |
| scheduled jobs | cronie, systemd timers | both. cronie needs a `run-parts` for cron.hourly, which no listed package provides (Fedora: crontabs, Debian: debianutils) |
| log rotation | logrotate, journald | journald handles the journal; logrotate for other files |
| man | man-db + groff + gdbm, mandoc | neither in the base (Scope). If a viewer is ever added, mandoc is one package where man-db is four |
| passwd.5, getspnam.3, crypt.3 | man-pages, shadow, libxcrypt | man-pages (sdk) for the first two, shadow's deleted; libxcrypt for crypt, man-pages' deleted |

## Deferred
* polkit: needs glib (built, for the guest agent) and duktape. duktape's
  git tree generates its sources with a Python 2 `dist.py`; only release
  tarballs are buildable. systemd only dlopens polkit at run time, so nothing else in the
  stage waits on it.
* gettext tools: the base ships gettext-runtime only (gettext, ngettext,
  envsubst; libintl is glibc's). msgfmt, xgettext and autopoint are build
  tools for the sdk stage.

## Circular dependencies
systemd links libmount and libblkid from util-linux, and util-linux links
libsystemd (journal output for logger/lslogins). util-linux-bootstrap,
`--without-systemd`, is what systemd is built against; util-linux is built
after systemd `--with-systemd`. shadow and dbus require systemd so their
logind and sd_notify integration is on.

## System integration
`pos-integration` is POS's own package for the files that make the
packages one system and that no upstream ships. Its source is
`pos/system/src/pos-integration`, a POS-owned tree (no upstream, so `get-latest.sh`
skips it); like any source, it is built from the committed tree. So far it
holds POS's PAM configuration: `system-auth`, the stack services include
(local accounts with `pam_unix`, a logind session with `pam_systemd`), a
file for every PAM service in POS (util-linux's login, su, runuser, chfn
and chsh, shadow's passwd, chpasswd and newusers, sudo, cronie's crond;
systemd installs its own), and `other`, which denies the rest. It is
installed into pam's vendor directory `/pos/share/pam/pam.d`, so it
applies without being copied to `/etc`, and `/etc/pam.d` overrides it per
service. shadow's and cronie's own files are not installed (shadow's are
for programs util-linux provides, with modules POS does not have).

It also holds the system's identity, `/pos/lib/os-release` (`ID=pos`;
see "Prefix"), and POS's systemd presets, `80-pos.preset`: networkd,
networkd-wait-online and resolved are enabled, ahead of systemd's
`90-systemd.preset` and of any preset a system adds. A system with POS as
its base is POS: pos-fedora stands in for Fedora's `fedora-release`
packages (`outputs/rpm-pos-fedora/fedora`), with their provides (dnf's
`system-release(releasever)`), so Fedora's identity and presets are not
installed.

Still missing for a bootable system: upstream cronie and logrotate install
no systemd units and no default `logrotate.conf`; `run-parts` has no
provider. These belong in pos-integration too (units, sysusers.d). The
policy for units no preset names is systemd's default, enable; Fedora's
`99-default-disable.preset` is not there.

# Network stage
The network stage (`pos/network/stage`) is the network tools, optional
on a system: it is not in `/pos` until enabled (see "Stage images"). It
builds on core-libs and system, whose systemd-networkd and
systemd-resolved configure the network without it.

* iproute2 (ip, ss, bridge, tc, devlink and the rest) with libmnl, libelf
  for tc's eBPF loader (no libbpf) and libcap; no arpd (Berkeley DB). Its
  default tables are in `/pos/share/iproute2`, which `/etc/iproute2`
  overrides per file.
* iputils: ping, tracepath, arping and clockdiff, without set-uid or file
  capabilities. ping uses ICMP datagram sockets, which systemd's sysctl
  defaults (`net.ipv4.ping_group_range`) allow every group; arping and
  clockdiff need root.
* ethtool, with netlink (libmnl). nftables with libnftnl and libmnl,
  readline for `nft -i` and JSON (jansson) for `nft -j`, which netavark
  writes its rules with (see "Container stage"); no iptables
  compatibility. nftables.service loads `/etc/nftables/rules/main.nft`
  where there is one.
* curl and libcurl: OpenSSL with OpenSSL's trust store (`/etc/ssl/cert.pem`,
  ca-certificates), HTTP/2 with nghttp2 (its library only), zlib and zstd.
  Not built for lack of the libraries: brotli, IDN (libidn2), libpsl,
  libssh2 (scp:, sftp:), GSSAPI, LDAP.
* GNU Wget2 and libwget, as Fedora has it, with `wget` a link to `wget2`
  (Fedora's wget2-wget): OpenSSL (its default is GnuTLS) with OpenSSL's
  trust store, HTTP/2 with nghttp2, pcre2, and zlib, zstd, xz and bzip2
  encodings; no libpsl, HSTS preload list (libhsts), IDN or brotli, and no
  man page (pandoc). Wget2 has no FTP or WARC, which Wget 1 had. Built from
  git with gnulib bootstrap, as the GNU packages of the system stage,
  synced without its submodules (gnulib is POS's, the wiki is not needed).
* rsync with popt, zlib and zstd from POS (not its included copies) and
  OpenSSL; no lz4 or xxhash. Its daemon units are installed.
* OpenSSH (ssh, sshd, scp, sftp, ssh-agent, ssh-keygen): configuration in
  `/etc/ssh` (factory), PAM on (the shipped `sshd_config`, edited in
  prepare) with pam's vendor file `sshd`, the privilege separation user
  `sshd` (sysusers.d) and directory `/var/empty/sshd`. POS's units:
  sshd.service (`Type=notify`; sshd notifies systemd itself) and
  sshd-keygen.service, which makes the missing host keys before sshd
  starts. No Kerberos, libedit, FIDO security keys or SELinux.

Wi-Fi (iwd, iw, wireless-regdb) and the packet capture tools are not in
the stage yet. RPM systems have no package of the stage: their network
tools are Fedora's (see "RPM packages").

# Container stage
The container stage (`pos/container/stage`) is podman and what it runs
containers with, optional as the network stage, which it requires (see
"Stage images"). podman is Go, netavark and aardvark-dns are Rust, built
with Fedora's compilers (see "Packages").

* podman, with rootlessport and quadlet (its systemd generators, in
  `/pos/lib/systemd`), its units, man pages and completions. Build tags as
  Fedora's, set by the recipe: seccomp, systemd (journald, sd-notify),
  sqlite (POS's, its database), libsubid (shadow's), Go's OpenPGP for
  signatures (no GPGME); no btrfs or AppArmor. The `/usr/share/containers`
  of podman's libraries, where vendor configuration is read, is
  `/pos/share/containers` (`configfile.systemConfigPath` at link time);
  `/etc/containers` stays the machine's. No podman-remote or docker
  compatibility script.
* containers-common, the configuration Fedora's package of that name has,
  from the container-libs tree (synced as a subset): the defaults of
  containers.conf, storage.conf, registries.conf, policy.json,
  seccomp.json, with their man pages. POS's settings are `00-pos.conf`
  drop-ins next to them: podman's helpers in `/pos` (`helper_binaries_dir`,
  conmon, catatonit, crun), the journald log driver, netavark, the overlay
  driver (rootless too, without fuse-overlayfs), and docker.io for short
  names. `/etc/containers` has its empty drop-in directories.
* crun (with json-c; its libocispec submodule generates C from the OCI
  schemas with Python): cgroup v2 through systemd, eBPF device rules,
  seccomp, capabilities; no CRIU, Wasm or libkrun. conmon (glib,
  libsystemd), catatonit.
* Networks: pasta (passt) for rootless containers, podman's default.
  netavark for rootful bridges, with nftables rules written through
  `nft -j` and its DHCP proxy for macvlan; aardvark-dns resolves container
  names on podman's networks. Both in `/pos/libexec/podman`.
* Rootless containers need subordinate ids: shadow ships empty
  `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` (factory), so `useradd` gives every new
  user a range, and newuidmap and newgidmap are set-uid. A user made
  before needs `usermod --add-subuids --add-subgids`.

Not in the stage: buildah and skopeo (podman build and podman image cover
most of their use), toolbox, podman-remote, slirp4netns, fuse-overlayfs
and iptables, which podman's current defaults do without.
